# Learning Hadoop #
This is a collection of project I've created to learn Hadoop with some notes.  
  
1. [Word Count](./word_count): the "Hello Word" of Hadoopers {basic Mapper and Reducer, Combiner}
2. [Average Grade](./average_grade): {Secondary Sort, custom types and comparator}
3. [Average Grade 2 - The Revenge](./average_grade_revisited): {Raw Comparator, In-memory Combiner, Counters}
